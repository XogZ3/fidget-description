### The Situation

> The new wave of web3 adoption will happen through games, but not how most people think.

Major gaming companies are attempting to build AAA games, like CS:GO, dota, minecraft, with hopes of building a big community. But this is improbable, as evident from the _unsustainability_ of building adoption through tokenomics, play-to-earn, NFTs, or gameplay alone. For example, alien worlds did not have a gameplay, and crypto kitties failed due to inflationary tokenomics.

Successful AAA games mostly have a niche audience who are long-time players with a passion for gaming. So it is unrealistic to expect an average person to try and commit to a new game in web3.

_Call of Duty: Warzone has 85 million players, Candy Crush has had more than one billion players_

However, casual games have an inherent problem, majority of them have _low retention_. The general pattern among casual gamers is that they flock to a new exciting game, then quickly get exhausted and move onto the next one.

### Our Approach
> **Fidget Games offers a single app which will give users a new game every day**, without having to updating the app or downloading from store

Our in-house game development team creates fantastic games with following things at the core:


• games appear within the same app, protecting the users from the burden of searching & downloading from store

• each game is wholesome with low complexity, giving a sense of comfort & familiarity - helping build a habit of _fidgeting_ around

• every game comes with new mechanics, unique artwork, instilling sense of achievement every day through exploring the gameplay

• there's a game for every one, as one size does not fit all

• games have infinite levels generated _automagically_

We believe that our games would dramatically improve retention, and that users will be interested in our unique proposition - enough to try and stick around, helping us realise our mission.

As our games have a _**24 hours shelf life**_, users will have to purchase the game to continue playing it. We expect this purchasing behaviour as

• our games have original designs

• limited time to make purchase decision

• highly engaging gameplay

• extended playability owing to auto-generated levels
### Our Gameplan

We aim to onboard users to web3 by providing options to buy today's game through _in-app purchase_ or a more affordable equivalent to _mint NFT_.

By displaying these options side-by-side, we highlight the extraordinary benefits**^** that web3 offers, thereby bringing users over. We expect this conversion to scale eventually as the ecosystem becomes more accessible and friction in web3 wallet management improves.

**^**Benefits:

• true ownership

• portability, transfer to other accounts (e.g., android to iOS)

• ability to trade in open market

• access to previous games via NFT marketplace

### Opportunity in MENA

> Global mobile gaming sector market cap is $138 billion, with 2.3 billion players as of 2023 - estimated to increase by 400 million by 2027

> MENA constitutes 15% of the global player base, and is predicted to **generate double the revenue by 2026** compared to $3 billion in 2021.

These fact motivated us to focus on transforming the gaming experience for the people, and facilitate true ownership of games and game assets.
### Blockchain

We have chosen to deploy Fidget Games on Venom Blockchain, to explore its fast transaction speeds and infinite scalability. We estimate it to have a higher growth potential as it is currently nascent and will be gearing up for mass adoption. This will be _mutually beneficial as both Venom and Fidget Games are striving to achieve mass adoption._
