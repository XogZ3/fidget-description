# Fidget Games

Mission: Bringing gaming nostalgia through daily mini-games and NFT ownership.
Vision: Become marketplace for **ALL** games

## The Team

Manish - CTO, gamer

Raunak - senior developer, gamer

Gokul - business developer, gamer

## The Problem

```
In a world overloaded with annoying ads in casual games, the real fun of playing often gets lost.
```

We recognize the people's frustration of constantly installing and uninstalling games as they flood the app stores. Independent developers struggle to reach their audience, while big companies dominate the top ranks and take a significant share of the revenue. It's time to break this cycle and create a win-win situation for everyone involved.

## The Opportunity

```
<INSERT #s for worldwide>
In the UAE alone, around 2 million people play mobile games, and this number is expected to grow to 2.33 million in the next five years.
```

Did you know that most of the revenue in the mobile gaming industry comes from casual games? This fact motivated us to focus on transforming the gaming experience for the people.

## The Solution

```
Fidget Games, play one new game every day.
```

**But here's the catch**: users will have the option to buy or mint NFTs that grant them lifetime access to their favorite games. If any user misses out on obtaining a specific game's NFT, they can purchase it from other users.

We believe that the element of scarcity, fear of missing out and potential to get rewarded for owning games will power our revenue stream, which we will share with the talented game developers. This way, everyone wins.

### Blockchain: Venom

```
<INSERT WHY VENOM> + UAE scope
```

To seamlessly integrate into the exciting world of Web3, we have chosen the Venom blockchain network. By leveraging this advanced blockchain infrastructure, we can reward users with free NFTs for their achievements. This approach aims to introduce more users to the Web3 ecosystem, encouraging widespread adoption.

### Tokenomics (is it required?)

Low trading fees

Mint fee and txn fee will go into governance treasury

Governance treasury reinvests into developing better games

Mint will have an upper limit of 1,000,000 for each game

Minting price is constant for all users

Exchange NFTs in our marketplace

## Let's get started

Embrace the future of gaming with "Fidget Games" â€“ where every day brings new adventures, every NFT holds endless possibilities, and every player becomes an integral part of the gaming revolution.

## Development Status

We have developed enough games to last a couple quarters, and have implemented basic web3 features. We plan to do a global launch by June.
