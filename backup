## Fidget Games
<br/><br/>
**Mission**: Bringing gaming nostalgia through daily mini-games and NFT ownership.

**Vision**: Become marketplace for **ALL** games.
<br/><br/>
### The Team

Manish - CTO, gamer

Raunak - senior developer, gamer

Gokul - business developer, gamer
<br/><br/>
### The Problem

> In a world overloaded with annoying ads in casual games, the real fun of playing often gets lost.
<br/><br/>
We recognize the people's frustration of constantly installing and uninstalling games as they flood the app stores. Independent developers struggle to reach their audience, while big companies dominate the top ranks and take a significant share of the revenue. It's time to break this cycle and create a win-win situation for everyone involved.
<br/><br/>
### The Opportunity

> Mobile games generate $90+ billion in yearly revenue, half of which comes from casual games!

> The UAE contributes $163 million, and ~2 million people play mobile games, and this number is expected to grow to 2.33 million in the next five years.
<br/><br/>
These fact motivated us to focus on transforming the gaming experience for the people, and facilitate true ownership of games and game assets.
<br/><br/>
### The Solution

> _Fidget Games_, play one new game every day.
<br/><br/>
**But here's the catch**: users will have the option to buy or mint NFTs that grant them lifetime access to their favorite games. If any user misses out on obtaining a specific game's NFT, they can purchase it from other users.

We believe that the element of scarcity, fear of missing out and potential to get rewarded for owning games will power our revenue stream, which we will share with the talented game developers. This way, everyone wins.
