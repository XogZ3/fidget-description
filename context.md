bring mass adoption to web3
general hypothesis that new wave of web3 adoption will happen through games
evidently polygon pivoted to gaming NFT

major players are attempting to build AAA games that potentially has a big community, like CS:GO, DOTA, minecraft - it is a shot in the dark to find success with this approach, to build a game with mass community adoption
proven multiple times that tokenomics, play-to-earn & NFT cannot alone bring adoption and cannot sustain if the game isn't engaging by itself, so gaming has been unsuccessful in making it happen. e.g., BIG FAILED GAMES

big games generally have a niche audience, who are hardcore gamers; but it is unlikely for an average person to try / adopt / commit to a big game

# of people playing casual games, candy crush, flappy bird, etc. vs. # of people playing AAA games

inherent problem with casual games is that do not have a high retention
majority of games have very low retention

the general pattern with casual gamers is they find an engaging game, exhaust it, then move onto the next game

offering users a single app which will give them a new game to play every day, without having to update the app or download from store

Our in-house game development team creates fantastic games with following things at the core:

- every new game appears within the same app, they are wholesome with low complexity, giving a sense of comfort & familiarity & home, avoiding the knee-jerk experience & anxiety of downloading new games - building a habit of fidgeting around
- each game comes with new mechanics, unique artwork, instilling sense of achievement every day by figuring out the gameplay, solving puzzles
- there's a game for every one
- all games have auto-generated infinite levels

We believe that this would dramatically improve retention, and that users will be interested in our unique proposition and try, and stick around, boost onboarding

#

As the games have a shelf life of only 24 hours, if the user wants to play it longer, they will have to purchase the game. We expect them to purchase,

- uniquely designed games
- 24 hour window to purchase
- highly engaging
- extend playability, auto-generated gameplay

We plan to onboard users to web3 by giving them options to buy today's game through in-app purchases or by minting an equivalent NFT.

By showing these options side-by-side, we intend to highlight the extraordinary benefits^ that web3 brings, thereby bringing users onto web3. We expect this conversion to scale eventually as the ecosystem becomes more accessible and friction for users to own wallet, use web3 improves.
^benefits:

- true ownership
- portability, transfer to other accounts (example: android to iOS)
- ability to trade in open market
- access to previous games via NFT marketplace

The success of Fidget Games has a bewildering consequence of becoming a lucrative alternative distribution & monetization platform, where game developers can break free from their dependency on playstore / appstore / steam, given that we will have built the ecosystem & user base.

> MENA region vs. world casual game # of users; overall mobile gaming sector revenue

We have chosen to deploy Fidget Games on Venom Blockchain, to explore its fast transaction speeds and infinite scalability. We estimate it to have a higher growth potential as it is currently nascent and will be gearing up for mass adoption. This will be mutually beneficial as both Venom and Fidget Games are striving to achieve mass adoption.
